Story:
	You start out in a lil mushroom house and your mom is feeding you dirt soup.
	Then suddenly a spider bursts through your door and eats your mom alive it's gruesome.
	He leaves you alive to suffer and die because -antagonist- and so you run outside
	to chase him and find a single blade of a pair of scissors. You wield this blade and
	cut down every spider in your path. You eventually find the spider that killed your mom
	and he bargains and says he'll tell you where your father is if you spare him. You are confused
	because your mom told you that he died in the great Roly Poly Holy War before you were born.
	No, says the spider, he is a great all powerfull beetle. You agree and he tells you how to reach him,
	and then you stab the spider in each of its 8 eyes anyway for being a mean ween. 
	blah blah gameplay somethin ok now you reach a temple inside an old tree trunk and you venture inside and
	find your real father, who tells you that he must kill you to keep his powers. He apologizes. You're like
	screw you man I just found out you're my dad I don't care about you and so you battle him and he's magic
	and stuff and you beat him if you aren't bad at the game (haha ben sux) and you can absorb his magic powers.
	this gives you the confidence to take on the great force of terror in the bug land, Spider King. 
	you use your newfound magic to give em a whoppin and then he's like: "Pill Bug: You were your own father all along"
	WooaAAhhHHH
